Due to the ongoing global pandemic I started to work mostly from home.
Beside my job as a software engineer I am also a volunteer firefighter in my local community.
This means that I'm on call for emergencies 24/7, also during my daily work as a SE.
When I am in the office and get a call, I can speak to my colleagues in seconds that I have to go (Or they just see me running to my car).
In booth cases they are informed that I am afk and can probably re-schedule or take over meetings for me.
When working from home I want to send an absence notification to my colleagues.
Chatting my 2-4 colleagues can be time-consuming.
Well, I am an engineer. I can automate this in combination with a big red button. I like big red buttons.
